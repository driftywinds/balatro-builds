Balatro releases for Android and iOS are possible due to [balatro-mobile-maker](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker/) and a legit copy of Balatro owned on Steam by me. Please __**ONLY**__ download this if you too already own Balatro on Steam, because I do not condone piracy of this game in any form or manner. I am not responsible for the actions of people who download from here, and I am trusting them to only use my builds to use their legit owned copy of Balatro from Steam on their phone.

I needed a way to auto-update so I established this empty repo with only releases for new versions of the game as they come out. You can copy paste this link - `https://github.com/driftywinds/balatro-builds` to add it to Obtanium and it will automatically update it for you. 

P.S. You can import saves from your pc into your phone yourself using the balatro-mobile-maker utility I have linked above.
